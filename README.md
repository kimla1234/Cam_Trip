If you want, I can:

- Fill the placeholders with your real GitHub Pages link and screenshot file names, or
- Generate a `LICENSE` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or
- Create a short `index.html` starter or GitHub Pages workflow file to deploy automatically.

Tell me which one you'd like and I'll add it directly.
